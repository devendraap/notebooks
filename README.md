## Getting started

Users also have the choice to fork or clone this repository into their local computer. Be aware that if you just clone the repository you will not be able to push changes into our master branch. Thus forking is probably better as it allows you to add new files and push changes.

``` git clone https://github.com/tradingeconomics/notebooks ```


## Credentials

While many examples can be run with an anonymous guest:guest key, the best path is for you to sign up for a free developer account at https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/ to get your own API key. With a developer account one gets free access to datasets from the Worldbank, the United Nations, the Federal Reserve, the EUROSTAT, and much more.  Dont' worry! We will never share your email information with anyone. If you do not want to register, consider, the API key guest:guest is very limited.

Please set your keys as Environment Variables

Linux

```bash
export apikey='guest:guest'
```
Windows

```bash
set apikey='guest:guest'
```

## Other programming languages

The Trading Economics API is also available for other programming languages. Providing several request methods to query our databases, with samples available in different programming languages, is the best way to export data in XML, CSV or JSON format and to subscribe to updates in real time.
